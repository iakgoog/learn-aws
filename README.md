## Architecting for Reliability on AWS

### Architecting for Availability

**Defining Reliability, Resiliency and Availability**

*Reliability or resiliency*
> The ability of an application to avoid and recover from failure

*Availability*
> The percentage of time that an application is performing as expected\
> Poor performance implies low availability\
> Uptime isn't the same as availability

*Decide how much availability you need before designing your AWS environment*
